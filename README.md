It's called "j1gui" but it's really not a GUI yet.

And it's probably not all that clear what "J1" is.

J1 is the name of a Forth CPU, written in Verilog and easy to get
running on an FPGA.

This code, at it's heart, is a simulator / disassembler for the J1
machine code, which is pretty much a straight translation of the Forth
source used to write the machine code.
